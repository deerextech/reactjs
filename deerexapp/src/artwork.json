One day I happened to think \"if someone were to sleep with Twinrova, would it be considered a three way?\" Because I think about the important things in life.  \r\n\r\nThus, the idea was born. That and I realized I've never done a female character before, besides Joan from Clone High and thought I should represent my gender at least once. ",

      "description": "Drawing armies = very repetitive.\r\nThat was the main lesson I learned drawing this one.\r\n\r\nWorth it though, because now I have a sweet Sokka drawing, Water Tribe war paint and all.\r\n\r\nI used navy for a lot of the shading and instead of #000 black style, I used a more charcoal grey.  Something I've been trying out, is seeing if I can carry out my dark style of art, using a lot less pure black.  Why? Great question. I did this because blending black into colours takes away the vividness of them. It drives me crazy, and so I have been gravitating toward only using it for outlines and completely blacked out areas.\r\n\r\nI like the results.  ",

Let's be real.\r\n\r\nSo, I thought about it, and came up with this. See, if this was Venusaur, I could tooootally understand going green. But in reality, it's like a derpy giant toad thing. \r\n\r\nThe worst part about this drawing, specifically for me, is that I created a Venusaur drawing that I like more then alllll my Charizard attempts.\r\n\r\nWhat a kick in the face, eh? Fucking Venusaur.",

Perhaps the scariest sentence I've said so far.\r\n\r\nBut in all fairness-- in order to take over a pride the other lion does have to beat the Alpha.\r\n\r\nAnd in more fairness, Scar's pitch to rule is that everyone could have food. He was just trying to end racism against hyenas. \r\n\r\nI hope I just shattered your childhood on some level. Or made you really angry. Or made a new friend. All three options make me happy.\r\n\r\nIf you made it this far, you get to know that this drawing glows in the dark.  It's part of a glow in the dark drawing series I'm currently (April 2017 currently) developing.",
